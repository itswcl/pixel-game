# Pixel Quiz Game

> 🤖 **About This Project**
> This project is the first experimental work completely developed using **AntiGravity IDE** in collaboration with AI. It aims to explore the potential of learning and application within an AI-native development environment. **0% of the code was written by humans**; every line of code (including the React frontend and Google Apps Script backend) was generated by AI. It also demonstrates how to use Google Sheets as a database to build a lightweight full-stack application.

This is a retro pixel-style quiz game built with React Vite, integrated with Google Sheets as a backend database for question management and score recording.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Retro Pixel Art Style**: A carefully designed 2000s arcade visual experience.
- 👾 **Dynamic Boss Avatars**: Uses the DiceBear API to generate a unique pixel avatar for each question.
- 📊 **Google Sheets Integration**: No traditional database required; manage questions and view scores directly in a spreadsheet.
- 📱 **Responsive Design (RWD)**: Supports both desktop and mobile gameplay.
- 🚀 **GitHub Actions Deployment**: Supports automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ Backend Setup (Google Sheets & Apps Script)

This project uses Google Sheets as the backend. Please follow these steps to set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new spreadsheet.
2. Name the spreadsheet `Pixel Quiz Database` (or any custom name).
3. **Create "Questions" Sheet**:
   - Rename the bottom tab/sheet to `Questions`.
   - Set the following headers in the first row:
     `ID` | `Question` | `A` | `B` | `C` | `D` | `Answer`
4. **Create "Responses" Sheet**:
   - Add a new sheet and name it `Responses`.
   - Set the following headers in the first row:
     `ID` | `PlayCount` | `TotalScore` | `MaxScore` | `FirstPassScore` | `AttemptsToPass` | `LastPlayed`

### Step 2: Deploy Google Apps Script

1. In the spreadsheet, click **Extensions** > **Apps Script** in the top menu.
2. Copy the entire content of the `google_apps_script.js` file from the project root.
3. Paste it into the Apps Script editor, overwriting the default code (`function myFunction() {...}`).
4. Click **Deploy** > **New deployment** at the top.
5. Click the gear icon ⚙️ > Select **Web app**.
6. Configure as follows:
   - **Description**: Pixel Game Backend
   - **Execute as**: **Me**
   - **Who has access**: **Anyone** ⚠️ _This is crucial; otherwise, the game cannot read the data._
7. Click **Deploy**.
8. Copy the generated **Web App URL**.

## 💻 Frontend Setup & Execution

### 1. Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variable example file
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Open the `.env` file and fill in the Web App URL obtained in the previous step:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
VITE_PASS_THRESHOLD=3  # Passing threshold (number of correct answers required)
VITE_QUESTION_COUNT=5  # Number of questions per game session
```

### 3. Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit the displayed Local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## 📝 Sample Questions: Generative AI Basics

You can copy the following table content directly into the **"Questions"** sheet in your Google Sheet for testing.
